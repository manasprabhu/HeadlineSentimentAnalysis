Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
Visualization of sentiment trends in news articles
Support for multiple datasets
Extendable to other text-based sentiment analysis tasks
Tech Stack:

Python
NLP Libraries (NLTK, TextBlob, VADER, etc.)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
